# Notes

## Don't criticize, condemn or complain.
- (Gavin) I can do this.  I can get better at this.

- People don't like to blame themselves.
    - (Gavin) Reminds me of the idea of scapegoating Peter Thiel spoke about and learned from Rene Girard.  I also have heard Bishop Baron talk about scapegoating.  I also remember a quote by Norm Macdonald: "The idiot sees the world as Good vs Evil. The cynic sees the world as Evil vs Evil. The truth that no one seems able to see is that the world is, and always has been, a battle of Good vs. Good."

- Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.  Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
    - (Gavin) Carol Dweck teaches about Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset.  It is good to strive for a growth mindset while being skeptical about whether or not the person you are engaging with has a growth mindset or a fixed mindset.

- B. F. Skinner proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.

## Give honest and sincere appreciation.
## Arouse in the other person an eager want.
- (Gavin) I am not good at this.  I trying to learn how to do this with my children.

## Become genuinely interested in other people.
## Smile
## Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
## Be a good listener.  Encourage others to talk about themselves.
## Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
## Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.
## The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
## Show respect for the other person's opinions.  Never say, "You're wrong."
## If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
## Begin in a friendly way.
## Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately.
## Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
## Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
## Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.
## Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.
## Appeal to the nobler motives.
## Dramatize your ideas.
## Throw down a challenge.
- (Gavin) Track metrics and this can encourage people to change.  I am reminded of Goodhart's Law which Marlyn Strathern summarized as "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."  In the software world we might measure number of commits or lines of code.  We might measure the number of hotfixes.

## Begin with praise and honest appreciation
## Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.
- (Gavin) Perhaps I can do this with non violent communication techniques.  Communicate observations and feelings.  Ask questions.

## Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
## Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
## Let the other person save face.
## Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.  Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."
## Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
## Use encouragement.  Make the fault seem easy to correct.
## Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

1. Be sincere.  Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.  Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.
2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.
3. Be empathetic.  Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants.
4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.
5. Match those benefits to the other person's wants.
6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.
