# Notes

## Don't criticize, condemn or complain.
- (Gavin) I can do this.  I can get better at this.

- People don't like to blame themselves.
    - (Gavin) Reminds me of the idea of scapegoating Peter Thiel spoke about and learned from Rene Girard.  I also have heard Bishop Baron talk about scapegoating.  I also remember a quote by Norm Macdonald: "The idiot sees the world as Good vs Evil. The cynic sees the world as Evil vs Evil. The truth that no one seems able to see is that the world is, and always has been, a battle of Good vs. Good."

- Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.  Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
    - (Gavin) Carol Dweck teaches about Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset.  It is good to strive for a growth mindset while being skeptical about whether or not the person you are engaging with has a growth mindset or a fixed mindset.

- B. F. Skinner proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.
